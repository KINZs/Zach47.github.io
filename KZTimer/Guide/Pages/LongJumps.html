              "Strafing is the foundation of another important KZ element: long jumps.
               Since strafing increases your speed while midair, that equates to an
               overall farther jump distance."

        <h1 class="col-12">Long Jumps</h1>

        <p>
          Before we go over the basics of a long jump, I want to introduce the best longjump guide made by a
          player named UdNeedaMiracle. See the guide <a href="http://www.kz-climb.com/advancedstrafing.html">here</a>.
          Anything below is detailed in his guide and more, and I recommend reading it once over to understand the depth
          of Kreedz and long jumping.
        </p>
        <p>
          To perform a basic longjump, run forward until you reach a velocity of 250 units per second  (u/s).
          This is the maximum velocity for running. Next, release your W key, jump, and start holding your D key
          while smoothly sliding your mouse a little towards the right. Halfway through the jump, release the D key
          and start holding the A key while moving your mouse a little towards the left. This is a longjump with two
          strafes, and the jump distance is greater if done correctly.
  	    <p>
          There are many factors that influence the distance of a longjump. The most important is your sync percentage.
          Your sync percentage is how well you synchronize the timing of your keyboard presses and the movement of your mouse.
          The better your sync is when jumping, the farther and more precise your jumps will be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another factor is the number of strafes. You’re probably wondering if more strafes equate to a better jump.
          Well, the answer is yes and no. More strafes CAN equate to a farther long jump, but ONLY IF your sync
          percentage is consistently high throughout the jump.
        </p>
        <p>
          A third factor that can influence the distance of your longjumps is the angle of your strafes.
          Strafing too wide can cause you to lose distance as you aren’t going enough in the right direction.
          Strafing too little can also be a problem as you don’t gain enough speed per strafe.
          It is recommended to experiment and to find a good “sweet spot” or angle that works for you and your number of strafes.
        </p>
        <p>
          To perform an even farther jump, the KZTimer Plugin implements a mechanic called pre-strafe.
          Pre-strafing is a running technique performed before a jump that allows you to move beyond 250u/s velocity.
          Press D and W while slowly moving your mouse to the right. If you do this correctly, you’ll
          notice that your velocity exceeds 250u/s. The idea is to reach 276u/s, as this is the maximum pre-strafe
          velocity, right before you perform the jump. Before finally jumping, release your W key, start to merge
          your pre-strafe direction key into an air-strafe. The smoother the transition, the better the pre-strafe.
        </p>
