    <h3>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch?
    I'll have you know I came top of my server in the kz-climb cup, and
    I've been involved in numerous secret raids on climb cove, and I have
    over 300 confirmed ownages. I am trained in starfing and I'm the top
    longjumper in the entire House of climb servers. You are nothing to me but
    just another 280 ljer. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the
    likes of which has never been seen before in this community, mark my
    fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over
    the kz-climb forums? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my
    secret network of cheat detectors across xtremejumps and your longjumps
    are being analysed right now so you better prepare for the ban, maggot.
    The ban that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your kz-stats
    profile. You're fucking gone, kid. I can bhop anywhere, anytime, and I
    can beat your times in over seven hundred maps, and that's just with my
    sideways runs. Not only am I extensively trained in bhopping, but I have
    access to the entire arsenal of the 1.6 kz mechanics and I will them to
    their full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of kzstats,
    you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution
    your little "world-record" longjump was about to bring down upon you,
    maybe you wouldn't have nulled. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now
    you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will get funk all over
    you and you will drown in bans. You're fucking gone, kiddo. - Flux</h3>
