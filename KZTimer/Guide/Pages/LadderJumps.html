        <h1 class="col-12">Ladder Jumps</h1>

        <p>
          A ladder jump or LAJ is when you strafe off a ladder onto a block away from it.
          This is the type of jump that the majority of KZ’ers struggle with the most.
          There are two methods used in ladder jumps: backwards and forwards/off to the side.
          Although many KZ’ers consider the forwards method to be the “correct” technique,
          some KZ’ers find doing ladders backwards to be easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before approaching ladder jumps, let’s talk a little bit about the takeoff from a ladder.
          First, let’s look at fast climbing. Fast climbing a ladder is when you ride a ladder upwards using
          A+W, or A+D while looking up in order to climb a ladder faster. You could think
          about this as the prestrafing of ladders. If you notice, you can also come off the ladder while fast-climbing.
          Ladder jumps are achieved by abusing the momentum from fast climbing into a smooth takeoff and air
          strafe from the ladder. You can also use ‘sideways momentum’ to come off a ladder. To do so, climb the
          ladder normally using W, and when you’re near the top, hold W+A or W+D briefly until you come off the ladder.
        </p>
  	    <p>
          <strong>Backwards Ladder</strong>: To perform an LAJ backwards, line up towards the side of the ladder, and then face backwards.
          Begin riding up the ladder using S. As you approach the very top of the ladder, hold S and D to gain speed,
          and begin to strafe towards the right in a 180 motion. As soon as you come off the ladder, release S, holding
          D to strafe towards the block. Strafe back towards the left to ensure a straighter air strafe, and hold crouch
          to ensure that you’ll land on the block. You can do LAJ’s the other way using S and A. To recap:
          You are essentially strafing off of the ladder into your normal air strafing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Forwards Ladder</strong>: To perform a ladder forwards, line up much the same as you would for a backwards ladder,
          except face towards the ladder. Fast climb up the ladder using W and D, and as you reach the top, face
          away from the ladder to “ride” off of it.  The angle at which to face away is a little bit more than
          parallel to the ladder. Note that you are still holding W and D as you do this. When you come off the
          ladder, transition into your air strafe using only D and A. This will take a lot of practice and learning
          when you’re coming off the ladder.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Sideways Ladder</strong>: A sideways ladder is a technique to use the sideways momentum from a ladder to
          launch yourself forwards. Line up around the same as any other ladder jump. I’d recommend near the side.
          Just hold W to climb up the ladder, and as you reach the top, hold A to begin to launch off the side of
          the ladder. As you start to come off the ladder, release W, make a small strafe to the left, and then
          transition into a right strafe. You should find yourself going forwards.
