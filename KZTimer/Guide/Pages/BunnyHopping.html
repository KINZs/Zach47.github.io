              "Bunny hopping, also referred to as bhopping, is a movement mechanic that allows a
               player to exceed the game-defined speed limit by timing a perfect jump that ignores friction."

        <h1 class="col-12">Bunny Hopping</h1>

        <p>
          Although bunnyhopping is indeed possible using the Spacebar, it is highly recommended to bind
          your jump to the scroll wheel. This is useful because you can easily trigger many jump presses
          in a second by scrolling your mouse, making the timing of the 1-frame gap much easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we mentioned in the introduction, you should bind your jump key to your mouse wheel.
          To bind your jump key to the mouse wheel:
        </p>
        <kbd>
          bind mwheeldown +jump<br>
          bind mwheelup +jump
        </kbd>
  	    <p>
          To bhop, you’re going to need to utilize the fundamentals of air strafing while timing your jumps.
          The first technique we’re going to learn is called ‘weaving.’ Run forward, release W,  jump, strafe
          towards the left, and in one fluid motion, as you’re about to hit the ground, jump, AND begin your
          strafe towards the right. If you do this correctly, you’ll find that you can do the same vice versa on the right side.
          This is the most commonly used bhop technique, and it’s what people attempt to do in competitive CS.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next technique is called ‘circle’ bhopping. Let’s assume you like to bhop out towards your left side.
          To perform circle bhops, run forward, release W, jump, strafe towards the left AND back towards the right
          before hitting the ground, then jump and repeat. Although this may seem like weaving with more strafes,
          this allows you to bhop in a straight line and is much more useful for bhopping on blocks along let’s say a wall.
          Try mixing up weaving and circle bhopping.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re still having a little trouble timing your jumps, try the warmup exercise we suggested earlier,
          but combine it into a bhop. Jump up and down in one place until you feel your jumps are becoming more consistent.
          Then, start strafing a bit on each hop. If you are timing your jumps and air strafing correctly,
          you’ll come out of jumping in one place and start bhopping.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may hear the term ‘wiggling’ described in bhopping. Wiggling just refers to how people are strafing
          during their bhops. It’s most often brought up when someone is strafing many times before hitting each hop.
          By the way, you can strafe as many times as you want before you hit the ground during a bhop, but
          it’s recommended not to overdo it as you may lose velocity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that <strong>bhopping in CS:GO is RNG</strong>. The term ‘RNG’ stands for Random Number Generator.
          This term is miscorrectly used quite a bit in the CS:GO/KZ world, but in terms of bhopping, it is
          completely warranted to use. Unlike 1.6 and Source, hitting “perfect” bhops that allow you to
          gain/maintain speed does not have anything to do with the timing of your jumps.
          You will not hit a perfect bhop with a badly timed scroll/jump, but there’s zero guarantee you’re
          going to hit a perfect bhop with a perfectly timed jump as well. To further iterate on just how RNG
          plays into bhopping: A perfect jump is when you hit a +jump on the exact tick that you hit the ground.
          A -jump also needs to occur to hit a hop, but the server can only listen to 1 input at a time.
          Basically, you have a 50% chance of hitting a perfect hop
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of the RNG of bhopping in CS:GO, speed management is a hard concept for newer players to grasp.
          It seems counter-intuitive to manage something that is random. It can be done however, but it’s really
          just a matter of watching your !speed panel, and grasping the feel of when you hit a perfect bhop.
          I cannot stress enough how important it is to get used to when you hit a perfect bhop vs when you don’t.
          The more aware you get of how a perfect bhop sounds, accelerates, and feels, the better you can learn to control
          it, strafe out of it, and utilize it for jumps in the KZ realm. You will learn how to consistently manage
          perfect bhops for long strings of bhop sections that require more than 250 u/s utilizing a
          technique called “kurouching” in the ‘technical KZ’ video.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s look at some of the other bhop jumps.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <strong>180-bhop</strong> is when you simply run forward, strafe left or right until you have turned 180 degrees,
          and then hop. This is useful for jumps that are too far/very-hard to longjump, especially on tiny blocks.
          Please don’t use this a crutch for completing KZ maps.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <strong>360-bhop</strong> is much like a 180-bhop, except, you guessed it, you do a 360 degree turn.
          Run forward, strafe left or right until you’ve completed a 360 turn, bhop, and strafe out of it.
          If you hit a perfect bhop, and your strafes are synced correctly, you can accomplish realistic gaps
          of 325 to 330 units. Now, it’s also called a 360 hop, b/c for jumpstats, you should get no more than 360 prespeed.
          However, you may be wondering if there’s a way to hit the 380 u/s speedcap. And yes, there is.
          Welcome to 380/360 bhops. Prestrafe just as you would a long jump, except do a 360 bhop at the end.
          This is going to require a smooth turn, a lot of mousepad room, and a perfect bhop.
          If you perform this correctly, you’ll hit the 380 u/s speedcap and be able to accomplish any giant gap in KZ.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <strong>multi-bhop</strong> is just like it sounds. It’s multiple bhops, and if you hit the 380 u/s speedcap while bhopping,
          you can travel very far distances. Although it’s fun to get jumpstats on multi-bhops,
          it’s much more consistent to utilize a 380/360 hop for getting across a huge gap.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <strong>drop-bhop</strong> is when you jump off a higher surface, bhop when you land, and strafe out of it.
          This is useful for comboing in maps, and some maps actually implement drop-bhop blocks.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <strong>weird-jump</strong> is similar to a drop-bhop, but with a lower falling distance.
          Instead of jumping off a higher surface, you prestrafe off of one.
        </p>
