              "KZ is a custom game mode that involves difficult jumps and hard obstacles.
              The goal is to traverse through the map with the fastest time.
              To do so, players must utilize Counter-Strike movement mechanics such as strafing, long-jumps, and bunnyhops."

        <h1 class="col-12">Introduction</h1>

        <p>
          This guide is being made to convert JWL's video tutorials to text and to include
          Zach47's more advanced tech. KZ (Kreedz) is a movement-based game mode where players
          compete for the fastest time on a map. You can see the whole list of maps and times
          at <a href="http://www.kzstats.com/">KZ Stats</a>.
  	    <p>
          KZ is short for Kreedz, the original creator of the game mode in Counter Strike 1.6.
          Kreedz maps often start with the prefix "kz_". However, other prefixes exist as well: bkz_, kzpro_, and xc_.
          Finding KZ servers to play on is easy. Simply go to your Community Server Browser and type “KZ” in the tags line.
          Alternatively, you can click <a href="http://www.kzstats.com/servers/">here</a> to view Globally Approved KZ servers.
          It is recommended to play KZ with at least 120 FPS, and with your jump key bound to your scroll wheel.
        </p>
        <p>
          To bind your scroll wheel to jump, copy these into your console:
        </p>
        <kbd>
          bind mwheeldown +jump<br>
          bind mwheelup +jump
        </kbd>
        <p>
          Once you have that set up, you're ready to join a KZ server! In KZ servers, there is a checkpoint system that allows you to save your position.
          If you mess up a jump, you can easily teleport back to your saved position. Runs done without the use of any teleports are known as PRO runs.
          Once you join a KZ server, you can start practicing "Air Strafing". Click below to learn what Air Strafing is.
